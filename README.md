# Fetal Health Classification

For this project a dataset was gathered from Kaggle and used to understand what factors contribute the most to fetal health being classified as Pathological. Several different models were implemented to see which models would yield the best results. K Nearest Neighbors became the leading model with a higher accuracy performance over the other two models. By implementing this model physicians can use CTG data to lower prediction errors.
